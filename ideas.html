  <h1>Ideas!</h1>
  <p>A list of ideas that I want to work on in the next few months:
    <ol>
      <li>Revisit the ROH data about choreographers. Extend it and make it look 'pretty' to practice UI.</li>
      <li>Look at social media usage around Ballet - graphs of ballet activity, comparisons of companies, analysis of #WorldBalletDay, top ballet tweeters etc.</li>
      <li>Interactive "Battle of the choreographers"?</li>
      <li>'Trending' - site to get info from a variety of sources. Top tweets, facebook page/public posts, news items from reputable newspapers, related facts from Wolfram Alpha.</li>
      <li>...?</li>
    </ol>
